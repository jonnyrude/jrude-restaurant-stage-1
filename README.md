# Restaurant Review Site
---
### Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project
For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.

I was also tasked witht initial step of changing this static site into a progressive web application by using the Cache API and writing my own service worker.

This project does not use any UI frameworks (i.e. jQuery, Angular, React, etc.)


### My Code

I created the `sw.js` and `sw-register.js` files to impliment the service worker. I edited all other JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files to fic the display and accessibility issues.
